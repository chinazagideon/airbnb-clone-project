## Project Overview

This Airbnb clone aims to replicate core functionalities of short-term rental platforms while allowing customization for niche markets (e.g., luxury stays, pet-friendly homes). 

**Development Priorities:**
1. MVP features (listings, bookings, payments)
2. Advanced additions (AI recommendations, dynamic pricing)

**Tech Stack Advantages:**
- Speed (Next.js)
- Scalability (PostgreSQL)
- Seamless user interactions

**Key Challenge:**  
Balancing real-time updates (e.g., booking conflicts) with performance. Consider WebSockets (Socket.io) for messaging/notifications.
