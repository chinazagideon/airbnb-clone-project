# Airbnb Clone Project Plan


## Project Overview

This Airbnb clone aims to replicate core functionalities of short-term rental platforms while allowing customization for niche markets (e.g., luxury stays, pet-friendly homes).

**Development Priorities:**

1. MVP features (listings, bookings, payments)
2. Advanced additions (AI recommendations, dynamic pricing)

## Project Goals

### Core Features
- Hotel Management Service
- Customer Service (Search + Booking)
- View Booking service
- Bookin system (reservations, calendars, payments)
- Reviews/ratings for properties and hosts

### User Experience
- Responsive design (mobile-first approach)
- Intuitive UI/UX (mimic Airbnb's clean aesthetics)
- Real-time messaging between guests/hosts

### Scalability & Security
- Role-based access (guests, hosts, admin)
- Secure payments (Stripe/PayPal integration)
- Optimized database queries for performance

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React.js (Next.js for SSR/SEO)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + CSS Modules (or Chakra UI)
- **State Management**: MobX - Automatic reactivity over explicit updates.
- **Maps**: Google Maps API or Mapbox

### Backend
- **Language**: Python (Django) - Web framework for rapid backend development (admin panel, ORM, security)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (relational) - Relational database for structured data (bookings, users, listings).
- **GraphQL**: Query language for efficient API data fetching (avoids overfetching).
- **Auth0**: Pre-built authentication (social login, JWT support)
- **Celery**: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
- **Redis**: Used for caching and session management.
- **Docker**: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

## Team Roles
- **Business Analyst (BA)**: Business analyser, responsible for business decisions.
- **Project Manager (PM)**: team management and motivation.
- **UX/UI Designer**: Create UI Design components and emplement.
- **Software Architect**: To ensure compliance to industry standard and building with best practices.
- **Software Developer**: A craftman that builds scalable apps and adaptive to changes.
- **Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer**: Makes sure an application performs according to requirements
- **Test and Automation Engineers**: For optimal test case and effeciency monitoring.
- **DevOps Engineer**: An engineer to manage software interaction with server, cost effective deployments and scalablity.


## Database Design

### Key Entities & Relationships

#### Users
- **Fields**: `id`, `email`, `name`, `role` (guest/host/admin)  
- **Relationships**:  
  - One-to-many with `Properties` (hosts own listings)  
  - One-to-many with `Bookings` (guests make reservations)  

#### Properties
- **Fields**: `id`, `title`, `location`, `price`, `host_id` (FK to Users)  
- **Relationships**:  
  - Many-to-one with `Users` (owned by hosts)  
  - One-to-many with `Bookings` and `Reviews`  

#### Bookings
- **Fields**: `id`, `property_id` (FK), `guest_id` (FK), `check_in`, `check_out`  
- **Relationships**:  
  - Many-to-one with `Users` (guest) and `Properties`  

#### Reviews
- **Fields**: `id`, `property_id` (FK), `guest_id` (FK), `rating`, `comment`  
- **Relationships**:  
  - Many-to-one with `Users` (author) and `Properties`  

## API Security

### Security Measures
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens verify user identity
- **Authorization**: Role-based access controls (RBAC) restrict actions
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute force/DDoS attacks
- **Data Encryption**: HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- **Input Validation**: Sanitizes all API inputs

### Why It Matters
- **User Data**: Protects PII from breaches
- **Payments**: Secures financial transactions
- **Listings**: Prevents spam/fraudulent content
- **System**: Maintains availability and integrity

## Feature Breakdown

### User Authentication
- Secure signup/login with email or social accounts. Enables personalized experiences and protects user data.

### Property Listings
- Hosts can create and manage property listings with photos, descriptions and pricing. Core to marketplace functionality.

### Search & Filters
- Users can search properties by location, dates and amenities. Drives discovery and booking conversions.

### Booking System
- Handles reservations, availability calendars and payments. Critical for monetization and user transactions.

### Reviews & Ratings
- Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties. Builds trust and accountability in the community.

### Messaging
- Direct communication between guests and hosts. Facilitates coordination and improves user experience.

### Admin Dashboard
- Moderates users, listings and platform content. Maintains platform integrity and safety standards.

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Overview
CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) automates testing and deployment processes. It ensures code changes are reliably tested and deployed to production.

### Why It's Important
- Catches bugs early through automated testing  
- Enables frequent, low-risk deployments  
- Maintains consistent environments from development to production  

### Tools  
- **GitHub Actions**: For automated testing and deployment workflows  
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent environments  
- **AWS/Heroku**: Cloud platforms for deployment
